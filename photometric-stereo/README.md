The objective of this assignment is to recostruct the shape of the object by given images derived under 
the different light directions. Computations of the `p` and `q` coordinates of the gradient space of the normal
performe by `photometric_stereo` function imported from `utils.py` file into the `main.py` file. `utils.py` contains
`plot_normal_map` and `plot_surface` functions for visualization of the results.
