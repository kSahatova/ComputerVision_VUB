In this project, two algorithms for optical flow computation were implemented. Both methods, namely Horn-Schunck and Lucas-Kanade, are represented in the `main.ipynb` file.
There are obtained images and gifs in the corresponding folders in the `Outputs` folder. 
To install all dependencies of the project, run `pip install -f requirements.txt`.
