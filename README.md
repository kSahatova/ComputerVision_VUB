Task 1. Calculation of the camera extrinsic and intrinsic parameters and axes reconstruction

All computations take place in the `main.py` file where by means of `utils.py` camera parameters are calculated and the resulting image is rendered.  
`xy_left.txt` and `xy_right.txt` are precomputed points in coresponding images
